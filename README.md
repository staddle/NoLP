# NoLP
Display a small window that hides the LP from your view after a ranked game 

Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open the window  
Press `Ctrl+Shift+E` or the `Exit` button in the window to exit the program

Currently the only way to see if the program is still running is to go to the task manager and look for the NoLP.exe. This will be improved by a tray icon in the future
